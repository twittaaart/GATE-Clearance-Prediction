## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the use of ML algorithms to predict whether a fresh graduate will successfully clear the GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering) based on academic and demographic data.

The goal was to provide early risk prediction to help students and educators take preventive or corrective action.
